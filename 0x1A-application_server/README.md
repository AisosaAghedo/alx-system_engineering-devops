Background Context


My web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that i installed in my first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project I will add this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to my Nginx and make it serve my Airbnb clone project
